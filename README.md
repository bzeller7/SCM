## I designed the page for the Imagination Studio, the art studio for the Organization where I work, Seattle Children's Museum. I want to showcase the page for the art studio since it is one of the popular exhibit. 

#The page consists of:
*The artist's page and the cards she made for her coworkers
*The youtube video of Raffi exploring around the Imagination Studio
*The page of the artworks from the visitors during their time at the museum
