## I designed the page for the Imagination Studio, the art studio for the Organization where I work, Seattle Children's Museum. I want to showcase the page for the art studio since it is one of the popular exhibit. 

The page consists of:
  1. The artist's page and the cards she made for her coworkers
  1. The youtube video of Blippi exploring around the Imagination Studio
  1. The page of the artworks from the visitors during their time at the museum
